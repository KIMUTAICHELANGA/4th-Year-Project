Crop Disease Detection and Crop Recommendation System
Overview
This project aims to address agricultural challenges by integrating computer vision techniques for crop disease detection and leveraging soil data to provide crop recommendations. Using TensorFlow for computer vision, the system detects diseases in crops through image analysis. Additionally, it utilizes soil data to recommend suitable crops based on soil characteristics.

Key Features
Computer vision-based crop disease detection
Integration of soil data for crop recommendation
TensorFlow implementation for image analysis
User-friendly interface for input and output visualization
